# Constraint Modules

This directory contains architectural constraint extensions to the Neutral Unified Verification Layer (NUVL).

Each module addresses a distinct authority-migration vector in distributed systems and defines structural prohibitions governing execution authority placement.

Modules may be independently applied or composed.

Unless otherwise specified, modules located in this directory are not covered by the Apache 2.0 license applied to the repository root.
