# Licensing Structure and Scope

This repository contains components subject to different licensing terms.

The Apache License, Version 2.0 located at the repository root applies **only** to:

- The `nuvl-core/` directory; and
- Any file that explicitly includes an Apache 2.0 license header.

No other directories, modules, demonstrations, extensions, or bundled builds are covered by the Apache License unless an Apache 2.0 header is explicitly present in the file.

---

## Proprietary Modules

All modules not explicitly marked with an Apache 2.0 header — including, but not limited to, directories under `/modules/` and designated demo or extension builds — are proprietary works.

These components are not released under the Apache License.

No license is granted for:

- Commercial use  
- Redistribution  
- Modification or derivative works  
- Production deployment  
- Patent rights  

except pursuant to a separate written commercial agreement.

---

## Research Evaluation

Limited, non-commercial research evaluation licenses may be available upon request.

No rights are granted by default.

---

## Controlling Terms

License scope is determined exclusively by the presence of an explicit license header within an individual file.

If a file contains an Apache License, Version 2.0 header, it is licensed under Apache 2.0.  
If it does not, it is not.

For commercial licensing inquiries or evaluation requests, contact the repository owner.
